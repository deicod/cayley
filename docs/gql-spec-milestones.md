# GQL Implementation Milestones and Tasks

## Milestone 1: Standards Alignment and Architecture Readiness
**Goal:** Establish foundational knowledge, requirements, and architecture scaffolding to host the GQL language.

### Tasks
1. Compile a living standards summary mapping ISO/IEC 39075:2024 constructs to Cayley capabilities and gaps.
2. Collect stakeholder use cases and define desired developer experiences across HTTP, REPL, and client SDKs.
3. Document success metrics, compliance suites, and benchmarking targets.
4. Register the `gql` language in `query.Language` and prototype a `GQLSession` honoring existing session options.
5. Audit QuadStore back ends for required features (labeled paths, temporal support, statistics) and record follow-up items.
6. Draft metadata catalog requirements for graphs, roles, authorization, and schema alignment using existing `schema`/`inference` packages.

## Milestone 2: Parser, AST, and Semantic Validation
**Goal:** Deliver syntactic and semantic front-end components required before planning and execution.

### Tasks
1. Implement the GQL grammar and AST generator under `gql/parser` with support for multi-statement scripts.
2. Build semantic validation in `gql/semantic`, resolving catalogs, schemas, and permissions.
3. Integrate error reporting consistent with GQL terminology into HTTP and REPL surfaces.
4. Create unit and integration tests covering parsing edge cases, semantic validation, and diagnostic flows.
5. Update documentation with early-language reference and developer onboarding notes.

## Milestone 3: Planning and Execution Integration
**Goal:** Translate validated GQL queries into executable plans backed by Cayley iterators.

### Tasks
1. Develop a `gql/planner` that converts semantic representations into logical iterator plans supporting patterns, path expressions, and tabular projections.
2. Extend optimizer components with GQL-specific cost estimation and rewrite rules using QuadStore statistics.
3. Ensure execution layers produce GQL-compliant result shapes (tables, graph views, JSON) with streaming optimizations.
4. Add benchmarking and regression tests comparing GQL performance with Gizmo/MQL equivalents.
5. Implement feature flags or configuration toggles to safely enable GQL in staging environments.

## Milestone 4: Ecosystem and Tooling Enablement
**Goal:** Provide end-user access, tooling, and operational support for the new language.

### Tasks
1. Expose GQL through HTTP endpoints, REPL commands, and client SDKs with language negotiation.
2. Update UI components for syntax highlighting, auto-completion, explain plans, and administrative controls.
3. Enhance configuration schemas, deployment manifests, and monitoring dashboards with GQL-specific fields and metrics.
4. Publish migration guides, tutorials, and code samples demonstrating GQL parity with Gizmo/MQL workflows.
5. Conduct usability testing sessions and incorporate feedback into tooling refinements.

## Milestone 5: Verification, Documentation, and Launch
**Goal:** Validate compliance, finalize documentation, and prepare for general availability.

### Tasks
1. Execute conformance suites, cross-backend regression tests, and interoperability checks with external GQL tools.
2. Finalize documentation, release notes, and upgrade guides covering known limitations and roadmap follow-ups.
3. Produce operations runbooks and support playbooks for monitoring, incident response, and maintenance cadences.
4. Define GA readiness gates (test coverage, performance thresholds, bug burndown) and secure approval from stakeholders.
5. Plan ongoing feedback loops and triage guidelines for GQL-related issues post-launch.
